Google Books Search Engine

## Description
This book usese the Google Books API to search for and save books for easy reference by users.
This project was a challenge in which I had to refactor an app from using a REST API to using GraphQL to query data.
I learned a lot about GraphQL, Apollo servers and how to incorporate these on both the client and server side of an application.
